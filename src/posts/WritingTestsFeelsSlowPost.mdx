# Writing Tests Feels Slow—Until It Isn’t

When a client recently asked, “Wouldn’t it be faster if we just skipped the tests?”, I knew where they were coming from. On the surface, writing automated tests can look like extra work—an added cost up front. But after nearly a decade of shipping software, I’ve found the opposite to be true: *tests are what make delivery faster, safer, and more consistent over time.*

This isn’t just a developer’s preference or a nice-to-have. Writing tests is one of the most effective ways to increase productivity and reduce long-term cost on a project. Let’s unpack why.

### 1. Tests Catch Bugs Early—When They're Cheap

Fixing a bug the day you write the code is cheap. Fixing it a week later costs more. Fixing it after the app is live? Now you’re losing time, trust, and money.

Tests act like a safety net. They catch bugs before a client or user ever sees them. That means less time spent manually testing, backtracking, or fighting fires after a release. The time you “lose” writing tests is gained back (and then some) by not scrambling to fix what broke.


### 2. Tests Document Behavior

A good test doesn’t just verify behavior—it *describes* it. When you read a test, you learn what the system is supposed to do, how it should respond, and what matters in a given flow.

This becomes even more valuable when onboarding new developers, revisiting features months later, or working in large systems where context is scattered. Tests become living documentation you can trust—not a stale wiki page no one updates.

### 3. Tests Make Refactoring Safe

Clients often want features delivered fast, but over time the codebase grows complex. Without tests, making a change in one place might silently break another. This fear of unintended side effects slows down development.

With tests in place, refactoring becomes safer. You can clean up code, improve performance, or adapt to new requirements without holding your breath. You get faster *because* you’re more confident.

### 4. Tests Pay Dividends in Long-Term Projects

In a short prototype or throwaway script, skipping tests might be fine. But if you’re building a product that’s going to grow—something that will get new features, support requests, and user traffic—tests are one of the best investments you can make.

The bigger and older the project gets, the more fragile it becomes *unless* you’ve built in the safeguards. Automated tests make sure your foundation stays solid as you build upward.

### 5. Tests Let You Move Faster Without Breaking Things

Imagine working in a codebase with zero tests. Every new feature feels like a gamble. Will this break something? Should we test the whole app again? Who knows. That leads to cautious, slow releases—or worse, broken ones.

With a good test suite, you get rapid feedback. You know instantly if something breaks. You can move quickly without losing sleep. In a fast-paced development cycle, that’s gold.

### Final Thoughts

Yes, writing tests adds a few minutes (or hours) up front. But those minutes protect days of lost time down the road. Testing is an investment in speed, not a tax on productivity.

So next time someone says “just skip the tests,” think about what that really means. You might be moving faster today—but you’re also signing up for slower, riskier, and more expensive changes tomorrow.

And if you’re building something that’s going to live longer than a few weeks, tests aren’t just helpful—they’re essential.
