# About Me
Hey, I’m Chase.

I’m a senior full stack engineer with 10 years of experience, currently working as a remote software consultant. Over the years, I’ve led teams, shaped architecture, and helped organizations deliver solid, maintainable systems using React, Node.js, .NET, Python, and PostgreSQL. I enjoy being hands-on with code, but I also thrive in leadership—guiding teams through planning, mentoring junior devs, and keeping projects on track without overcomplicating things.

Outside of work, life looks a little different.

My family and I live on a homestead out on the acreage. We raise animals, grow our own food, and do our best to live close to the land. It’s not always easy, but it’s deeply rewarding. I’m a Christian, a husband, and a father—and I take those roles seriously. They shape how I live, how I work, and what I value.

When I’m not coding or chasing animals around, you’ll usually find me in the woodshop, picking up my guitar, reading something by Tolkien (again), or out hunting and fishing.

This blog is where I share what I’m learning—technical insights, hard lessons, and a few strong opinions—written with clarity and care for fellow builders.

Thanks for being here.
